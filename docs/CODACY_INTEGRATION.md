# Codacy Integration Guide

This document explains how the BetaNet C Library integrates with Codacy for code quality analysis and coverage reporting.

## Overview

Codacy provides automated code review and quality analysis for the BetaNet project, monitoring:

- **Code Quality**: Static analysis, style issues, and best practices
- **Security Issues**: Vulnerability detection and security patterns
- **Test Coverage**: Code coverage tracking from CI/CD pipeline
- **Complexity Metrics**: Code complexity and duplication analysis

## Current Metrics

[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/1af29499c2b94e41899ea67601b8eb6b)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/Blank902/BetaNet/dashboard)
[![Codacy Coverage](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Coverage/1af29499c2b94e41899ea67601b8eb6b)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/Blank902/BetaNet/dashboard)

- **Overall Grade**: B (74/100)
- **Total Issues**: 339 across 9,860 lines of code
- **Issue Percentage**: 46% (target: ≤20%)
- **Code Duplication**: 12% (target: ≤10%)
- **Complex Files**: 23% (target: ≤10%)
- **Coverage**: Tracked from CI pipeline

## Repository Setup

The repository is already configured with Codacy. The integration includes:

### 1. Automated Analysis

- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic analysis on push and PR
- **Multi-language Support**: C, Markdown, and YAML analysis
- **Security Scanning**: Built-in security pattern detection
- **Quality Gates**: Configurable quality thresholds

### 2. CI/CD Integration

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) includes:

```yaml
- name: Upload coverage to Codacy
  uses: codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter-action@v1
  with:
    project-token: ${{ secrets.CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
    coverage-reports: coverage.info
```

### 3. Required Secrets

For coverage reporting, the repository needs:

- `CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN`: Project-specific token for coverage upload
  - Available in Codacy dashboard → Settings → Integrations → Project API token

## Code Quality Standards

### Current Issues Breakdown

The project currently has 339 issues across several categories:

- **Security**: Potential security vulnerabilities
- **Error Prone**: Code patterns likely to cause errors
- **Performance**: Performance optimization opportunities
- **Code Style**: Formatting and style inconsistencies
- **Complexity**: Overly complex code structures
- **Best Practice**: Deviations from C best practices

### Quality Goals

Target improvements:

1. **Reduce Issues**: From 46% to ≤20% issue percentage
2. **Reduce Duplication**: From 12% to ≤10%
3. **Reduce Complexity**: From 23% to ≤10% complex files
4. **Maintain Coverage**: Track and improve test coverage

## Tools Configuration

### Static Analysis Tools

Codacy uses multiple analysis engines:

- **Clang-Tidy**: C/C++ static analysis
- **Cppcheck**: Additional C/C++ checking
- **PMD**: General code quality patterns
- **Security tools**: Built-in security analysis

### Configuration Files

The project includes configuration for external tools:

- `.clang-format`: Code formatting standards
- `.clang-tidy`: Static analysis configuration
- `.markdownlint.yml`: Markdown linting rules

## Workflow Integration

### Pull Request Analysis

Codacy automatically:

1. **Analyzes changes**: Reviews only modified code in PRs
2. **Posts comments**: Inline feedback on issues
3. **Updates status**: Pass/fail based on quality gates
4. **Tracks coverage**: Coverage changes in PR context

### Quality Gates

Current quality gates check for:

- **No new security issues**: Critical security patterns
- **Coverage maintenance**: No significant coverage reduction
- **Complexity limits**: New code complexity thresholds
- **Duplication limits**: New code duplication thresholds

## Dashboard Access

Access detailed analysis at:
[Codacy Dashboard - BetaNet](https://app.codacy.com/gh/Blank902/BetaNet/dashboard)

Dashboard features:

- **Issues Overview**: Categorized issue breakdown
- **File Analysis**: Per-file quality metrics
- **Trends**: Quality metrics over time
- **Coverage Reports**: Detailed coverage information
- **Security Issues**: Security-specific analysis

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Review Issues**: Check Codacy feedback before merging
2. **Fix Security Issues**: Prioritize security-related findings
3. **Maintain Coverage**: Ensure new code includes tests
4. **Follow Standards**: Use configured formatting and analysis tools

### For Maintainers

1. **Monitor Trends**: Track quality metrics over time
2. **Update Goals**: Adjust quality gates as project matures
3. **Configure Tools**: Fine-tune analysis tool settings
4. **Review Reports**: Regular quality assessment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Coverage Upload Fails**
   - Check `CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN` secret
   - Verify coverage file format (LCOV)
   - Review workflow permissions

2. **Analysis Not Triggered**
   - Confirm GitHub integration is active
   - Check repository permissions
   - Verify webhook configuration

3. **False Positives**
   - Configure tool-specific ignore patterns
   - Use inline comments to suppress issues
   - Report issues to Codacy support

### Getting Help

- **Codacy Documentation**: [docs.codacy.com](https://docs.codacy.com)
- **Project Issues**: Use GitHub issues for project-specific problems
- **Codacy Support**: Contact through Codacy dashboard

## Next Steps

To improve code quality:

1. **Address Security Issues**: Priority focus on security findings
2. **Reduce Complexity**: Refactor complex functions and files
3. **Eliminate Duplication**: Extract common code patterns
4. **Improve Coverage**: Add tests for uncovered code paths
5. **Standardize Style**: Apply consistent formatting across codebase

The Codacy integration provides continuous feedback to maintain and improve code quality throughout the development lifecycle.
