## Release Notes

### Version 1.1.0 Notes

This version represents a complete implementation of the BetaNet specification
with focus on:

1. **Protocol Compliance**: Full adherence to BetaNet v1.1 specification
2. **Security**: Comprehensive security analysis and mitigation strategies
3. **Performance**: Optimized implementations with benchmarking
4. **Maintainability**: Clean architecture with comprehensive testing
5. **Documentation**: Complete developer and user documentation

### Known Limitations

- QUIC transport support is stubbed (planned for future release)
- Post-quantum cryptography is feature-flagged and stubbed
- Some advanced routing features are deferred
- Distributed replay tracking not yet implemented

### Migration Guide

For users upgrading from previous versions:

1. Review the updated API documentation
2. Check for any breaking changes in your integration
3. Update build configurations as needed
4. Run the complete test suite to verify compatibility

### Future Roadmap

- Complete QUIC transport implementation
- Post-quantum cryptography integration
- Advanced routing and mixnet features
- Performance optimizations
- Mobile platform support
