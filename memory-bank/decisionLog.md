# Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-08-14 | Implemented complete TLS server-side functionality with certificate loading, SSL context management, and ALPN negotiation | This enables full end-to-end encrypted communication over real SSL connections. The three-layer security stack (TCP/TLS/Noise XK) is now complete and production-ready. Combined with existing client-side TLS and Noise XK handshake implementation, this provides a fully functional encrypted networking platform. |
