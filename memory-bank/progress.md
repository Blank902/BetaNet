# Progress (Updated: 2025-08-13)

## Done

- Fixed CLI runtime issues by resolving OpenSSL DLL dependencies
- Unified thread function signatures using platform abstraction
- Successfully implemented demo mode stubs for all core BetaNet functions
- Achieved working CLI demonstration showing peer-to-peer session simulation
- CLI now runs to completion demonstrating HTX transport and Noise XK handshake workflow

## Doing

- Fine-tuning demo mode implementations to improve data exchange simulation
- Preparing for next development phase with real network functionality

## Next

- Implement actual network socket operations to replace demo stubs
- Add proper error handling and retry logic for network operations
- Implement real Noise XK handshake with OpenSSL cryptographic functions
- Add SCION path selection capabilities
- Integrate traffic shaping and governance mechanisms
