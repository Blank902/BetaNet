# Active Context

## Current Goals

- Major breakthrough completed! Successfully implemented real Noise XK handshake over SSL connections. The system now automatically detects when real SSL connections are available and switches from demo mode to actual encrypted communication. Fixed critical bug in responder handshake and created comprehensive integration test demonstrating the complete workflow. All functions (handshake initiator/responder, secure send/recv) now work with real SSL connections while maintaining fallback to demo mode. Ready for certificate support to enable full server-side TLS functionality.
