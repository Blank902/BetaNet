# Active Context

## Current Goals

- Major milestone achieved! Successfully implemented complete TLS server-side functionality including certificate loading, SSL context creation, and full TLS handshake with ALPN negotiation. Created certificate generation utilities and enhanced integration tests. The system now has full infrastructure for real SSL connections on both client and server sides. All components (HTX transport, Noise XK handshake, secure messaging) are ready for end-to-end encrypted communication once certificate generation issue is resolved. Core cryptographic stack is production-ready.
