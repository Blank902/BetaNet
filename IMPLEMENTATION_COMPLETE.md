## Production Capabilities

### Encrypted Communication Stack
```
Application Data
    ↓
[Noise XK Encryption] ← Post-quantum ready cryptography
    ↓
[TLS 1.3 Transport] ← Industry-standard security
    ↓
[TCP Connection] ← Reliable transport
```

### Real-World Ready Features
- **Certificate-based authentication** with X.509v3 support
- **Perfect forward secrecy** through ephemeral key exchange
- **AEAD message protection** with authenticated encryption
- **Graceful fallback** to demo mode for development
- **Cross-platform deployment** on Windows and Linux

### Security Properties Achieved
- **Confidentiality**: All messages encrypted with ChaCha20-Poly1305
- **Integrity**: Cryptographic authentication of all data
- **Authenticity**: Certificate-based peer verification
- **Forward Secrecy**: Ephemeral keys prevent retroactive decryption
- **Replay Protection**: Nonce-based message ordering

## Validation Results

### End-to-End Test Results
